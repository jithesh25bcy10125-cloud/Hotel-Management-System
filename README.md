# Hotel-Management-System


 # Overview

This project is a simple Python-based Hotel Room Management System.
It runs in the terminal and allows you to manage hotel rooms easily. You can add rooms, search for them, book them, check them out, and view all rooms in one place.

The idea is to mimic basic hotel operations in a clean and understandable way.

Search for rooms quickly using the room number

Book rooms if they are available

Checkout rooms to make them available again

See all rooms along with their current status — Booked or Available

Simple menu-based navigation that anyone can use



 # Technologies Used

Basic input/output

Lists and dictionaries for storing room data

Command-line interface (no external libraries required)
