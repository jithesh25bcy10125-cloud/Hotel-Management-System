# Project Statement – Hotel Room Management System

# Problem Statement

Managing hotel rooms manually can become confusing and inefficient, especially when the number of rooms increases. Staff may struggle to track which rooms are available, which are booked, and what types of rooms exist. There is a need for a simple system that can handle basic hotel room operations without complexity.

This project solves that problem by providing a basic, menu-driven application that helps hotel staff manage rooms easily.




 # Scope of the Project

Adding new rooms with details

Searching for a room

Booking and checking out rooms

Viewing all rooms with their status


The project focuses only on room management and does not include advanced modules such as payment processing, customer records, or online integration.

It aims to provide a simple and beginner-friendly tool to manage room details without any technical complexity.
